Currently, the center coordinate is [{centerX}, {centerY}], and current zoom level is {zoomLevel}. Baesd on these values, decide where you want to pan next and create an action for next center coordinates and next zoom level and execute it.

Format the output as an array of pan actions like this:
    [
      {
        "action": "pan",
        "x": panPosX,
        "y": panPosY,
        "zoom": zoomLevel
      },
      ...
    ]
    Only return valid JSON â€” no markdown or comments.
